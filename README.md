<h1>‚òéÔ∏è CONTACTS APP</h1>

<p>This is a Contacts App project, similar to the one we have in iOS. </p>

<p>You can test it live on this <a href="https://contact-app-taupe-sigma.vercel.app/">link</a>.</p>

<h2>üß≠ Some context</h2>
<p>I'm a 2x founder that led Product and Growth strategies and teams from scratch to 40+ people and US$20+ million in revenue with an exit to a public-traded company.</p>
<p>As a seasoned tech entrepreneur with an engineering (not tech) background, I've always thought of learning to code as a way of becoming a better founder & tech leader. </p>
<p>In July/24, I decided to go for it and have been learning on my own, through resources like Codecademy & Scrimba, and counting with the -incredible- mentorship of my former Tech Lead. <br/><small>[shout out and much love üíú to @vinimdocarmo]</small></p> 
<p>This is my first portfolio-grade project and although I'm sure there's a lot of things to improve, I'm also very happy with the result and looking forward to keep learning.</p>
<p>Let's go build something great! ü§ò</p>

<h2>üß∞ Built with</h2>
<ul>
    <li>App in React</li>
    <li>Auth & Data persisted in Supabase</li>
    <li>Navigation with React Router</li>
    <li>Hosted on Vercel</li>
    <li>Styling with CSS</li>
    <li>AI with GROQ</li>
</ul>

<h2>‚úÖ Features</h2>
I'm not reinventing the wheel here...
<ul>
    <li>Sign-in via Magic Link</li>
    <li>See real-time contact list by alphabetical order</li>
    <li>Add new contacts with name, phone and profile img</li>
    <li>Update an existing contact</li>
    <li>Remove contact</li>
    <li>Generate a new contact with AI</li>
</ul>

<div>
But what I actually think that brought most value was to:
<ul>
    <li>Build something from scratch by myself</li>
    <li>Use map, spread operator & others</li>
    <li>Manage States & Context</li>
    <li>Set up React forms</li>
    <li>Deal with API calls to Supabase with useEffect</li>
    <li>Set up row-level-security, using & communicating real-time with a database</li>
    <li>Manage authentication & user permissions</li>
    <li>Implement routing & navigation</li>
    <li>Playing with AI with GROQ api</li>
    <li>Create responsive styling</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h2>üîÆ Next features to implement</h2>
This got interesting and, as a beginner, I totally acknowledge that there are things to improve. A few of those include: 
<ul>
    <li>Allow to sign-up with email+password or via gmail</li>
    <li>Improve app structure between pages vs components</li>
    <li>Add more properties for each contact</li>
    <li>Upload profile picture</li>
</ul>

<h2>üí¨ Feedbacks welcome</h2>
<p>If you have any thoughts on it, feel free to reach out. I'd love to get some feedbacks and improve on my skills!</p>
Cheers,
